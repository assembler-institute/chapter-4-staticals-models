## Section A

Load "iqphys.csv" and do a multiple linear regression:

- Which of the predictors explains some of the variability in intelligence quotient (IQ)?
- What is the effect of brain size (Brain), after taking into account weight and height?
- Give a confidence interval for the coefficients
- What is the IQ confidence interval for the predictor values: brain size = 95, height = 70, weight = 180?
- Do the residuals follow a normal distribution? Make the histogram and quantile-quantile plot representations convenient.

## Section B

Load the `prostate.csv` dataset
- Remove the train column
- What is the best model that explains the variable lpsa?
- Give a confidence interval for the coefficients
